##  .Description
##      This script mimics a suspicious and possibly malicious process.  
##      It writes to a cleanup log (default /var/log/fakebad.log) with information 
##      about its actions.
##
##      The binary will randomly select to exhibit one the following profiles:
##          0 - no actions, just a running process
##          1 - running process that opens a file and writes to it every 5 seconds
##          2 - running process that opens 1 to 3 network listeners (randomly decides 
##              if tcp, udp, or raw) on random ports
##          3 - running process that opens file and network listener
##
##      It should be compiled into a binary using a tool such as pyinstaller on 
##      the system which it will be run. 
##           Example: pyinstaller --onefile fakebad.py
##
##      It should be started using the accompanying startfakebad.sh script.
