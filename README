README FAKEBAD 

fakebad was created to work on techniques to locate a malicious or possibly malicious binary running on a linux system. 

The python script should be converted to a binary file with something like PyInstaller.
The shell script is used to launch the binary.

The binary will randomly select to exhibit one the following profiles:
 - no actions, just a running process
 - running process that opens a file and writes to it every 5 seconds
 - running process that opens a network listener (randomly decides if tcp, udp, or raw) on random port
 - running process that opens file and network listener

For clean up purposes, if the script profile that is randomly chosen writes to a file, the script will always write the location of the file it creates to its own log file at /var/log/fakebad.log .
To clean up these files, run:
	cat /var/log/fakebad.log | xargs rm
	rm /var/log/fakebad.log


The shell script (startfakebad.sh) asks for the location of the binary file. It then checks for links to that file from previous runs of this script for clean up purposes. If more than one link exists, the additional ones are deleted.

The shell script then choses a random process name from the processes currently running on the system to use as a disguise.

Finally, the shell script executes the binary using the link name.
